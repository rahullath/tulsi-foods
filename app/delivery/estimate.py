"""Live delivery-fee estimates for checkout display.

Quotes come from Borzo's `calculate-order` (the real courier price for the
pin's location) — not the old distance-zone table. The zone table is kept as
the availability + minimum-order source and as an offline fallback.

Free-delivery is currently PAUSED (config.FREE_DELIVERY_ENABLED = False), so
every delivery shows its live fee. Zone fallback respects the same flag so the
two paths never disagree.

Quotes are cached briefly (5 min, bucketed by rounded coords + subtotal) so a
pin drag doesn't hammer the courier API for every pixel move.
