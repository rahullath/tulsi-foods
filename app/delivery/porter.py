"""Porter — the delivery partner (Oct 2026 decision; Borzo/Shiprocket retired).

Two modes, one interface:

- **Manual (default, works today).** Porter's merchant API is gated behind
  their enterprise team (our sign-up was geo-restricted, see
  docs/COURIER_ROUTER.md), so the kitchen books each rider in the Porter app.
  This module turns an order into a ready-to-paste booking card (pickup,
  drop, Maps pin, customer phone, cash to collect), which is sent to Telegram
  when the POS marks the order food-ready and shown in the admin panel. Mom
  pastes the Porter tracking link back and the customer gets it.
- **API (later).** When Porter issues an API key, implement `quote()`/`book()`
  below and set PORTER_API_KEY; `orders.dispatch_rider()` already calls
  `book()` first when `api_configured()` is true, so nothing else changes.

Uber Direct was evaluated too: in India it runs only as an ONDC logistics
provider (launched Bengaluru, Dec 2025), with no merchant API and no Chennai
service yet. Revisit if that changes.
